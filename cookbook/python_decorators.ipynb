Designed for both sync and async functions, it automatically manages the creation and lifecycle of traces, spans, and generations. It captures key execution details such as inputs, outputs, metadata etc.\n",

Its seamless integration with the Langfuse platform gives you a powerful toolset for monitoring, debugging, and optimizing application performance and LLM usage.\n",

This hierarchical structure allows for a detailed and organized view of application performance and behavior.\n",

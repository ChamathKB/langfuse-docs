# Deploy Langfuse on Porter.run

import DeploymentGuideCallout from "@/components-mdx/deployment-guide-callout.mdx";

<DeploymentGuideCallout />

If you use [Porter](https://porter.run) to deploy your application, you can easily add a Langfuse instance to your cluster via the "Add-ons". The add-on will automatically configure the necessary environment variables, inject your database credentials, handle HTTPS and custom domains, and deploy and autoscale the Langfuse container.

Thanks to the Porter team for this great integration!

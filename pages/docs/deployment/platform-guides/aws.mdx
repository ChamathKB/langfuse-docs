# Deploy Langfuse on AWS

import DeploymentGuideCallout from "@/components-mdx/deployment-guide-callout.mdx";

<DeploymentGuideCallout />

We recommend deploying Langfuse on AWS using the Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Fargate for a scalable and low-maintenance container deployment. Note: you can use AWS Cognito for SSO.

import { ChangelogHeader } from "@/components/changelog/ChangelogHeader";

<ChangelogHeader />

```mermaid

    A(Session) -->|1:n, sessionId| B(Trace)
```

**Traces can now be grouped together to form a session:** Add a `sessionId` string when creating/updating a trace. All traces with the same `sessionId` will be grouped together.

- Bookmark a session to easily find it later
- Manually evaluate sessions by adding `scores` from the Langfuse UI
